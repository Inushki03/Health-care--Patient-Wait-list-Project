# Patient Waiting List in Health care
#### Project Overview
Analyzed hospital patient waiting list data by comparing Inpatients (admitted >1 day) and Day Cases (discharged within the same day) over four years. Explored changes in average and median patient counts across different time bands and age groups. Developed monthly trend analysis to identify patterns in patient admissions. Provided insights into healthcare demand, service usage, and seasonal variations, supporting better planning and resource allocation.
